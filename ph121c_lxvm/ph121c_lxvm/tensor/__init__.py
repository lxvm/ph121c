"""Implement elementary tensor network construction and operations.

Currently performs matrix product state (MPS) representations and operations.
A good overview of the topic is available here:
https://tensornetwork.org/mps/

This module defines two classes to do MPS/MPO operations:
mps: instantiation of a matrix product state representation of a vector
    with methods for index contraction and calculating products
mpo: representation of matrix product operators
    
This module defines classes that are essential to the MPS/MPO classes:
site:
train: collections of sites
