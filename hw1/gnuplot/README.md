# Gnuplot

To build the plots in this folder, it should suffice to run the shell script
via `$ . ./processing.sh`.
Note that the plot data lives in `../fortran/data/` and you must generate it first.
The data will be processed and reformatted in `./data/`.
The plot outputs will be in `../tex/include/plots/`.
