# Fortran

## About

There are the following types of files in this directory:
- Programs: These have the following prefix:
  - [:digit:]: Contain parameter sweeps that call the modules
- Modules: These have one of the following prefixes
  - solvers: contain routines for doing individual simulations with data collection
  - tfim: routines for building TFIM Hamiltonians
  - matrix_helpers: miscellaneous routines for printing matrices

## Before compiling

This project uses the intel oneAPI base and HPC toolkits, which can be obtained from
[here](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/free-intel-software-developer-tools.html).
Have the intel `ifx` compiler ready, such as by running the 
intel oneAPI `setvars.sh` script.
I use this alias: `oneapi='. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh intel64 mod'`.

## Compiling

This files in this directory can be compiled via this command:
`$ . ./bin/compile_lines.txt`.

## Before executing

Before running any of the generated binaries in the `./bin/` directory,
you may want to increase the stack limit on your machine in to avoid
segmentation fault errors due to the large matrices being tested.
I found it necessary to do `$ ulimit -s unlimited` before running
anything big.

## Executing

The compile lines placed all the binaries in `./bin/`, but you must
execute them from `./` in order for the results to be saved in `./data/`

Some data on runtimes is printed to the screen while running, but I saved it using
for example `$ ./bin/1_dense_ed.out | tee -a ../data/runtimes.dat`

## Analyzing

The data generated by the simulations is stored in `./data/` and the data
files can be read there in plain numerical format.
Also see `../gnuplot/README.md` for how to generate graphics.
