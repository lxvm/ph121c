    "Clearly, God did not conceive the universe as a point because God would not be\n",
    "able to take the outer product of two points to obtain vectors.\n",
    "So in the beginning, there were at least two vectors, and God took the outer\n",
    "product to make higher order tensors, the inner product to make lower order \n",
    "tensors: these were the binary operators on tensors.\n",
    "God defined these tensors over a field and also used the transpose and inverse.\n",
    "We believe God may have saved us because God invented index notation \n",
    "so that any of this could make sense.\n",

    "\n",
    "Sometimes smart people find ways to represent large tensors by smaller tensors,\n",
    "and this assignment is originated in this observation.\n",
    "The goal is to rewrite a tensor of dimension $d^L$ which describes the state\n",
    "of a qu$d$it chain of known $L$ength as a matrix product.\n",
    "We do so using the SVD and Schmidt decomposition techniques explored earlier.\n",
